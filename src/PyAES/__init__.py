"""
This is a AES-128, AES-192, AES-256 bit encryption algorithm (Rijndael cipher)
implementation in Python 3.10 (also tested in 3.9) (no external libraries needed)
that can be used as an external library for AES encryption in python.

OBS!
Please note that this is a purely educational project designed to be used as a
testing, evaluation and learning platform and by that no security can be guaranteed
for the data encrypted and decrypted with the project. The project is not intended
to be used for any type of security purposes.
