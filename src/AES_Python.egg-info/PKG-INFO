About
---
This project is a way for me to structure and work on my gymnasium project where i implement the AES encryption algorithm in python to the evaluate it and write a report about it. This project is written in pure python and do not use any external libraries for the core module "AES_Module". The project and the code is not intended for any use outside of educational and no security can be guaranteed for any encryption and/or decryption that uses this implementation. Do also not that this is not going to be the most efficient implementation due to my limited coding skills and knowledge, but i have tried to do my best to make it as efficient as possible so it´s not to slow to work with.

This implementation of AES (Advanced Encryption Algorithm) algorithm is implemented with a number of different running modes such as ECB and CBC with more coming soon (see list below for updated information)...

Implemented running modes
---
- [x] **ECB** - Electronic Code Book mode (For more information see ...)
- [x] **CBC** - Cipher Block Chaining mode (For more information see ...)
- [ ] **CFB** - Cipher Feedback mode (For more information see ...)
- [ ] **OFB** - Output FeedBack mode (For more information see ...)
- [ ] **CTR** - Counter mode (For more information see ...)
- [ ] **GCM** - Galois/Counter mode (For more information see ...)
